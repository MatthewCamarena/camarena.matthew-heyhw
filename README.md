# Baby Stats Project
This project was designed to introduce the concept of data structures. 


## Baby class
The Baby class has two constructors: the default constructor and a parameterized constructor.
The default constructor takes no arguments while initializing variables for the name and weight of the baby. The parameterized constructor requires a string variable and an int variable, which would be the name and weight respectively.
This class also has two functions, both of which are getter methods: getWeight() and getName(). Both can be used to get the information of the specific baby the user is looking for.

## Medical Record class
The class medical record is used to store data of the babies.
