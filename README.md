# Baby Stats Project
This project was designed to introduce the concept of data structures. 
From a small and large text file full of baby names, and their respective weights included, we were assigned to store them in any data structure we knew. where we would be able to quickly compute the following: most popular name, number of births, number of babies with low birth weight, and the total number of babies from any given name.

# Summary

## Baby class
The Baby class has two constructors: the default constructor and a parameterized constructor.
The default constructor takes no arguments while initializing variables for the name and weight of the baby. The parameterized constructor requires a string variable and an int variable, which would be the name and weight respectively.
This class also has two functions, both of which are getter methods: getWeight() and getName(). Both can be used to get the information of the specific baby the user is looking for.

## Medical Record class
The class medical record is used to store data of the babies.
