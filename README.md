The class baby has two constructors. Both of which uses the cariables name and weight which are used to store the data of each individual baby.
The default constructor of course has nothing in its parameter while the second constructor requires a string variable and an int variable.

The class medical record is used to store data of the babies. 
In the constructor of this class, two dynamic arrays are initilized. One used to store the baby names, the other used to store the weights.
